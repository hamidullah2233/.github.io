                    My name is <strong>Hamidullah Khan</strong>. I am a student of <strong>BS Computer Science</strong>. This is my first personal website, which I created using only <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>. I made this website to help students
                    with their 4th semester notes and video lectures. The website is simple and easy to use. It allows students to read notes and watch helpful study material. I am still learning and practicing web development. In the future, I want to
                    improve my skills and make more useful websites for education. This website is a small step in my learning and freelancing journey. Thank you for visiting my website. I hope it helps you in your studies.
