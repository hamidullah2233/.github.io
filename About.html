    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is <strong>Hamidullah Khan</strong>. I am a student of <strong>BS Computer Science</strong>. This is my first personal website, which I created using only <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>. I made this website to help students with their 4th
        semester notes and video lectures. The website is simple and easy to use. It allows students to read notes and watch helpful study material. I am still learning and practicing web development. In the future, I want to improve my skills and make
        more useful websites for education. This website is a small step in my learning and freelancing journey. Thank you for visiting my website. I hope it helps you in your studies.

        I help students across Pakistan find their right career path. <br> I have helped many students find their path to success. In the next few decades, <br> Pakistan will rise as the leader of the world with a maximum young workforce, <br> but for
        this, we need some good pilots who can take us through this.
